    <p>For democracy to thrive, democratic governance has to work. Yet we are confronting an exploding number of complex
      societal challenges from climate change to inequality and our public capability to tackle these problems,
      individually and collectively, is eroding. By some measures, the situation is quite dire as evidenced by the
      rapidly declining trust in our public institutions and their capacity to create public value.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="intro-text right">
    <p> This program offers a systematic method for using <b>data</b>, <b>public engagement</b>, <b>collaboration</b>,
      <b>innovation</b> and <b>new
        technology</b> to solve problems more effectively and legitimately.<br>

      We teach you the innovative craft of taking projects from <b>idea to implementation</b> in government.<br>

      By working differently – using <b>agile methods, data analytics, collective intelligence and behavioral
        insights</b> – we

          class="material-icons down"></i></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          In this session, we introduce you to the latest digital government technologies that you will need to know,
          such
          as big data, machine learning, collective intelligence tools, blockchain, expert networks, Internet of Things
          and chat bots. We
          want
          to make sure everyone has the same baseline level of tech literacy. In addition to explaining these
          technologies
          and what they are, we address how governments are using them with special emphasis on their
          institutionalizations
          and the ethical issues that may arise.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion"><span id="bold">Session 2</span>&nbsp- Defining a Public Problem<i
          class="material-icons down"></i></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>

          One cannot come up with workable solutions until one has defined, as concretely as possible, the problem to be
          solved. Problem definition is the process of narrowing a major issue down to a more readily definable and
          solvable
          smaller problem by hypothesizing why a problem is occurring and identifying its root causes. The process
          generally
          involves a multi-step process of defining and re-framing the problem to arrive at either a narrower or a new
          understanding of an actionable challenge. Problem definition skills include developing a hypothesis; defining
          and
          re-defining root causes and requires the capacity to listen all people affected or involvement in that
          particular
          area inside and outside the organization.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion"><span id="bold">Session 3</span>&nbsp- Human Centered Design Strategies<i
          class="material-icons down"></i></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>

          You can solve problems faster and more effectively when you understand the environment, wants, and needs of
          those
          you are trying to help. Thus, we focus next on human-centered design (HCD). HCD is a process that starts with
          the
          people you’re designing for and ends with new solutions that are tailor made to suit their needs. It consists
          of
          ethnographic practices that involve observing or talking to those affected by a policy or service to
          understand
          their needs, desires and experiences. For a design to be truly human-centered, it should engage and involve
          users
          from start to finish. Human-centered design involves skills such as interviewing, prototyping and journey
          mapping.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion"><span id="bold">Session 4</span>&nbsp- Understanding the Problem with Data: Data
        Analytical Thinking<i class="material-icons down"></i></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>

          By making it possible to measure past successes, spot present disparities, and predict future performance,
          data
          is
          becoming a key tool for making decisions and tackling problems in every arena. Next we turn to identifying the
          data we need to understand the problem and develop some basic skills in data analysis needed to develop
          projects
          further. Data helps us both to define the problem and establish metrics and indicators of success. Data
          analytical
          thinking emphasizes the value of data to achieve improved outcomes and equities, reduced cost and increased
          efficiency in how public policies and services are created. Data analytical skills include formulating a
          hypothesis, identifying data to test a hypothesis, spotting patterns and predicting trends from data and
          sharing
          data responsibly. We also study methods of sharing data for social good pioneered by the GovLab open data and
          data
          collaboratives.

      <button class="accordion"><span id="bold">Session 5</span>&nbsp- Open Innovation: Tapping collective intelligence
        to solve problems<i class="material-icons down"></i></button>

      <div class="panel">
        <p>

          Open innovation describes the distributed process of working across organizational boundaries to accelerate
          innovation. Open innovation enhances both the effectiveness and legitimacy of policymaking. As we know from
          restaurant reviews on Yelp and medical discussions on WebMD and Patients Like Me or from reading entries on
          Wikipedia, productive knowledge is widely distributed. People have diverse forms of expertise, from lived
          experience to professional know-how. The value of more open innovation is that it leverages this collective
          intelligence that go beyond preferences and opinions to accelerate the solving of public problems. Open
          innovation
          skills include the ability to define a clear and compelling goal, determine appropriate incentives, define the
          task for people to do and decide how to use their contributions to support future decision-making and actions.
          We
          learn key techniques including crowdsourcing, crowdlaw and social auditing.</p>

          Bill Clinton famously said, “Nearly every problem has been solved by someone, somewhere. The challenge of the
          21st
          century is to find out what works and scale it up.” Solid research is essential to the work of the public
          entrepreneur. Before championing an intervention, she needs to know whether it is likely to improve outcomes?
          Will
          the results be worth the investment it will take to bring about this change? What alternative solutions are
          out
          there? How does she know what the right – or at least likely – answers to these questions are? Thus, the
          public
          entrepreneur cannot afford to ignore any possible solution, whether the subject of a narrow randomized
          controlled
          trial or a broad scale pilot in the field but without formal evaluation. We learn how to get up to speed
          quickly
          both on academic research and on social innovation.</p>

      <button class="accordion"><span id="bold">Session 7</span>&nbsp- Behavioral Insights and Experiments to Test What
        Works<i class="material-icons down"></i></button>
      <div class="panel">

        <p>
          An inductive approach to policy making that combines insights from psychology, cognitive science, and social
          science with empirically-tested results to discover how humans actually make choices. Behavioral insights aim
          at
          improving the welfare of citizens and consumers through policies and regulations that are formed based on
          empirically-tested results, derived using sound experimental methods. We learn together the skills of knowing
          how
          and why to design an experiment, such as a randomized controlled trial, measure the results and know how to
          scale
          the learnings.</p>

        <p>

          The magnitude and urgency of challenges such as climate change, social inequality, and technology-generated
          un(der)employment calls upon us to work together. With the right design, and far more effectively than if we
          acted
          separately, we can concentrate resources and energy to tackle our shared problems. A leading-edge example of
          partnership is the Pathways in Technology Early College High School (P-TECH). This six-year program takes Year
          9
          students through to an associate degree by Year 14, to prepare them for a career in a STEM (science,
          technology,
          engineering, math) field. There is no entrance exam and admission is by lottery to improve equity. P-Tech
          began
          as
          a partnership between the New York City Department of Education, the City University of New York (CUNY) and
          IBM.
          Working together, the partners launched the first school in Brooklyn in September 2011, graduating the first
          class
          in 2017.</p>
